***Instructions for Shell***

Example usage of shell.c Assuming program is run on a Unix system with the gnu c compiler available:

step1: gcc -o s shell.c

step2: ./s

step3: now you will be presented with a welcome message and "prompt>>" on the terminal

example execution: 

Prompt>> grep fork() shell.c

with output:

    int fork1 =  fork();
      int fork2 = fork();


Have fun using my shell! There are likely several things that other shells can do that mine cannot.
